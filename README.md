# Zomato Dataset Analysis (Exploratory Data Analysis)

## Overview
This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a Zomato dataset to uncover insights related to customer preferences, restaurant types, and ratings. Using Python and data visualization libraries, we explore key questions to help Zomato optimize its services.

## Key Challenges Addressed
- What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?
- How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?
- What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?
- What is the average spending of couples on online orders?
- Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating?
- Which type of restaurant receives more offline orders, helping Zomato provide targeted offers?

## Dataset
The analysis is based on a **Zomato dataset** (CSV format) containing details about various restaurants, their ratings, and customer behavior.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation
- **NumPy** – for numerical analysis
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for data visualization
- **Plotly** – for interactive charts
